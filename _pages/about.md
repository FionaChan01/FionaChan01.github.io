> Mood 🤓: OMG, Just love STRANGER THINGS 4 !!!!!

- 👋 Hi, I’m Qianchen (Fiona), happy to meet you here!
- 🏫 I’m currently studying in Chongqing University as an undergraduate.
- 👀 For now, I’m interested in FL and NLP, and these are the places where my recently research lays.
- 🤗 I do enjoy lots of hobbies! I relish sports are hiking, yoga, loping, tennis, gym working, swimming and so on. Also, I am a big fan of movies and books. It is pretty hard to tell all my favorites, but I can rank _Cloud Atlas_, _Fight Club_ and _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_ as my top3. I'd be quite thrilled if we share the common taste! Do let me know!
- 📣 Oh right! I'm totally obsessed with the Lord of the Rings and the other tales about the Middle Earth in Tolkein's books.
- 🥰 Feel free to check my homepage! It is then meaningful only because you are here!
